    <p class="p-q">Q: How do I locate and pair my LED light unit to my mobile device?</p>
    <p>A: Click "+" to scan, and select the device(s) that need to be added. Always make sure to first select the white box next to the light’s name, and then the red circle with the white check mark at the bottom of your screen.</p>

    <p class="p-q">Q: The FluvalSmart app is requesting a password/PIN number. What should I do?</p>
    <p>A: The default password/PIN number is 000000.</p>

    <p class="p-q">Q: Is the FluvalSmart App compatible with all Android and iOS devices?</p>
    <p>A: The FluvalSmart app supports Android systems above 4.3 and iOS systems above 9.0. With the abundance of phones on the market, Fluval cannot guarantee that all customers will have the same mobile app experience. Should you find any bugs, please contact us so we can debug and release an updated version.</p>

    <p class="p-q">Q: How will the light run after a sudden power failure?</p>
    <p>A: If in Manual mode, the light will continue to operate as it was before powering down. If in Auto or Pro mode, once powered back on, the light will run starting from 00:00 and will require connection to a mobile device with the app to have its clock reset to the current time. If you are not present after a power failure, we recommend having someone with the app connect to your light unit and re-establish the correct time.</p>

    <p class="p-q">Q: How can I obtain support for the FluvalSmart app?</p>
    <p>A: A playlist featuring step-by-step instructional videos for all Fluval Bluetooth LEDs and the FluvalSmart app can be found on our YouTube channel. You can also contact us at FluvalSmartApp1@gmail.com about the issues you’re experiencing.</p>

    <p class="p-q">Q: How do I know if my light parameters are entered correctly?</p>
    <p>A: When connected to the light, you can inspect the light setting parameters/time chart.</p>

    <p class="p-q">Q: Can I view my settings before I make them live?</p>
    <p>A: Yes, there is a "Preview" function for this purpose. After your settings are entered, Preview shows your 24-hour light schedule in one minute.</p>

    <p class="p-q">Q: How do I save my light settings?</p>
    <p>A: Click "Save" at the bottom of your screen to save your customized settings.</p>

    <p class="p-q">Q: Can I copy/paste my settings if I connect a second light?</p>
    <p>A: Yes. First, enter your desired light settings on the first light and save your profile (naming it "Light 1", for example). Next, open the second light in the app. Select the Export feature, and you should see the name of your first light setting ("Light 1") along with any other preset light profiles. Select "Light 1" and hit the Export command: both lights will now be using the same settings.</p>

    <p class="p-q">Q: Can I undo or revert back to older light settings if I don’t like my newly entered parameters?</p>
    <p>A: If you have saved your previous settings, you can return/import them. Otherwise, you will need to enter them manually again.</p>

    <p class="p-q">Q: How can I identify a particular light if there are several paired lights together in a room?</p>
    <p>A: Click the three dots at the top right corner of the screen, and then "Find". The lamp will flash to identify itself.</p>

    <p class="p-q">Q: How can I manage my device list if there are too many devices showing?</p>
    <p>A: If too many devices are showing in the device list, or you don't need all of them any longer, you can swipe left on any row and select "Remove" to delete them.</p>

    <p class="p-q">Q: What's the maximum remote distance to operate my light using a mobile device?</p>
    <p>A: Around 40 feet (12 meters).</p>

    <p class="p-q">Q: What happens when I exit the App?</p>
    <p>A: Whether it's in Manual, Automatic, or Pro mode, the light unit will continue to operate in the same mode it was in before you exited.</p>
