    <h4>I'm having trouble connecting my light to the FluvalSmart App. What should I do?</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>When connecting your mobile device to the FluvalSmart App, please use the following sequence: Open the app → Plug in the light unit → Find the light unit using the app.</li>
        <li>If you own a Fluval Plant Spectrum or Marine Spectrum Bluetooth LED, make sure the touch-switch on the light unit is illuminated in green. If not, continue pressing the touch-switch until it does turn green and then re-attempt to connect the light to your mobile device using the FluvalSmart app.</li>
        <li>Ensure that Bluetooth is enabled within your mobile device settings.</li>
        <li>Make sure that Location Services is turned on in your mobile device settings.</li>
        <li>If you are encountering a connection issue while adding the light unit to the FluvalSmart app, ensure you first select the white box next to the light’s name, and then the red circle with the white check mark at the bottom of your screen to complete the connection.</li>
        <li>If you have experienced a power failure or have unplugged the light unit, you must reconnect the light with your mobile device to reestablish the correct clock time as the light unit will otherwise default to midnight.</li>
        <li>Try connecting another mobile device to your light unit to determine if the issue is caused by your mobile device or its operating system. Although many mobile devices have been tested with the FluvalSmart app, it is possible that newer operating systems are not yet compatible.</li>
        <li>If you see several Bluetooth devices appearing on your device, try turning them off and reconnecting to your light unit.</li>
        <li>If none of the above tips help, uninstall the app from your mobile device and then reinstall the most current version available from Google Play or the App Store.</li>
    </ol>
